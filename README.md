# Node.js Mentorship Program

My aim in joining the mentorship program is to increase my knowledge in this field and I believe there is no better way of doing so than by a hands on approach. 
I believe that this program would benefit me in my pursuit of building web apps and help me find effective ways and means to integrate all that I learn through this in my future projects.
